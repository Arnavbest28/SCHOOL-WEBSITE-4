            <br>
            <p>
                We at DPSG strongly believe that the more rooted we are, the stronger we grow in life. Our Alumni is a strong force that binds us with our roots of wisdom. The illustrious journey and glorious achievements of our school is because of our dynamic students. Our alumni have established themselves as successful professionals and we couldn’t have been prouder.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Indeed, you deserve to be cherished and remembered…</p>
            <p class="text-muted">This is rightly so, for the school has for now over 41 years, been an epicenter of academic, sporting, and civic excellence. It has been the cradle that has fostered the development of young men and women who have gone on to become leaders in business, the law, medicine, science, the arts, technology to name a few.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Welcoming back former students is a moment of nostalgia as also of happiness. Having you back evokes cherished memories as also enables to reminisce and relive golden days of school life.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">A school’s alumni are the reflection of its past, representation of its present and a link to its future. They are a strategic asset for an educational institution willing to stand out from the domestic and international competition by being a powerful resource for the school and its students both today and in the future. Your active enthusiastic involvement is critical to the success of our students as it allows students to gain knowledge and perspective.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">With the advent of social media, alumni connect has taken a different flavor. I take this opportunity to invite our talented and well-placed alumni who are blessed with a wealth of experience and skills to reach out to our current students by sharing their expertise and best practices via talks and webinars. You can serve as a beacon of hope for many by donating your valuable time and mentoring them by offering to support them in work placements and help them launch their careers. This kind of support will go a long way in enhancing students’ experience and give them that competitive edge in today’s tough job market.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">With your cooperation, our educational and cultural programs can acquire a new dimension and flavor. You can assist in recognizing and honoring other meritorious students who have succeeded in their careers and life.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">We would like to reiterate that your contribution to your alma mater can inspire the lives of students today who are destined to be the leaders of tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">In school days, we adhered with each other as part of one institution. Be it academics, sports, extra-curricular or mere brawls, we glued as one. It was always the sense of belonging to this institution that brought us together.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Today, we look back to our school and a string of nostalgia binds us together. Like the yesteryear, we wish to stick with each other under one umbrella, but with a difference!!</p>
            <p class="text-muted">We want to give back to school the way it has chiseled our inner and outer selves.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">We all have joined hands not only to be in touch with each other, but also to pool in a few steps that Delhi Public School Ghaziabad takes on to reach higher grounds.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">We want to set an example for the present students, provide newer avenues to the school, and convert into actual, the ideas that school inculcates in its students.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">We further wish to take this bridge across from school to the society at large.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">A defined purpose to contribute to the growth of school and welfare of society thus lends a matured character to this juncture, where we all are ‘bonded with a purpose’.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Our Beginning</p>
            <p class="text-muted">" I walked in, I touched the walls, I felt the ambiance,
                and oh …I wanted to come back to it again and again… "</p>

            <p class="text-muted">That’s how we all feel whenever we go back to school!</p>
